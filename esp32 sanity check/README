1. Wiring Overview
ESP32 Pin Assignments (example):

Relay IN → GPIO 27 (controls pump)
Relay VCC → 3.3V
Relay GND → GND
Pump: Connect one pump wire to relay NO, the other to power (see below)
BME680 (SPI example):
CS → GPIO 5
MOSI → GPIO 23
MISO → GPIO 19
SCK → GPIO 18
VCC → 3.3V or 5V (check your module)
GND → GND
LCD (I2C example):
SDA → GPIO 21
SCL → GPIO 22
VCC → 3.3V or 5V (check your module)
GND → GND
Pump Power via Relay:

Relay COM → Pump negative/one wire
Relay NO → GND (if low-side switching) or +V (if high-side, but low-side is safer for most DC pumps)
Pump other wire → Power supply (+V)
